- Resistance is measured in Ω
- You know that the narrower the wire through which electricity passes, the more the resistance it has.
- The most common type of resistors called /Carbon Film/ resistors are made up of a carbon tube into which a grooves have been cut.
- The grooves mean there is less carbon for the current to pass through, so the resistance can be increased by having a deeper groove.

- Resistors are colour coded so we can tell what there resistance is.
- Most resistors have 4 bands painted on the outside.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Resistor.JPG
- Starting at the opposite end to the Gold or Silver band (In this image that would be the right hand side):
  - The first band gives us the first number
  - The second band give us the second number
  - The third band gives us the number of zeros.
  - The fourth bands gives us the tolerance.

| Silver |          |          |                       | 10%       |
- So for example, the resistor pictured above has the colours:
  1. Brown - 1 (First number is 1)
  2. Black - 0 (Second number is 0)
  3. Yellow -4 (4 zeros)
  4. Gold - +/-5%
- This means it is a 100000Ω resistor, or what we would normally call a 100kΩ resistor.
- The 5% tolerance means that the actual resistance can vary by + or = 5%, which in this case would be 0.05 X 100000 = 5000Ω

- For each resistor, use the colour table to identify it's resistance.
* Ohm's Law
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- You've seen how increasing the resistance in a wire can effect the current passing through the wire.
- It is therefore possible to reduce the amount of current flowing in a circuit, by adding in resistors.
- To do this we use =Ohm's Law=
#+BEGIN_HTML
<math display='block'>
<mi>V</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mi>I</mi>
<mi>R</mi>
</math>
#+END_HTML
- =V= is for Voltage, =I= for current and =R= is for resistance.
- We can rearange the equation to make =I= the subject, which will allow us to calculate the current in a circuit.
- Look at the animation below to see how.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<object data="js/Ohms_Law.html" width='500px' height='300px'></object>
#+END_HTML
- So there are three different ways of writing Ohm's Law

- Sometimes the current is described in =mA=. This is short for milliamps, which are a thousandth of an amp. (Just divide it by 1000 to calculate the current in amps)
